00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
IN THE SHADOW OF PRINCES

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.203
1332. Stephanus sacerdos de Kulakuta
solvit VI denarius – recorded

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:30.264
by a papal delegation tasked with
collecting ecclesiastical tithes.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
That is to say, the priest István from
Fântânele paid six denarii in taxes.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:44.288
Despite its small congregation, it
supported a priest and had its own church.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.547
Among the tombs unearthed
in the present-day church

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:50.272
nave, one contained a
S-shaped hair ornament,

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:55.096
a typical accessory from the Árpádian
era, dating back to the 1100s.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.920
In the 1400s, the Fântânele family
stood out both in wealth and in rank.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:08.794
Among its members, Péter served as a
royal judge in Mureș Seat in 1451.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:14.710
The name of György appears first in the
matriculation records of the University

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:19.418
of Vienna, and later in higher ecclesiastical
positions, notably as a canon.

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:25.442
The painting of the church walls also
likely took place during the 15th century.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.391
The most well-preserved
details of the frescoes

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.524
were discovered along
the southern gallery.

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:38.594
A notable motif found is the
image of Christ, depicted with

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.548
his head drooping from the
sarcophagus and his hands relaxed.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.667
This portrayal of Christ, known
as the “imago pietatis”, aimed to

00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:51.524
evoke the compassion of the faithful
by visualizing the dead Christ.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.400
The legend of St George the Dragon
Slayer, depicted on the wall opposite,

00:01:57.448 --> 00:02:01.612
expresses the Christian
belief that faith can

00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:06.072
vanquish demons and defeat
evil in all its forms

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.129
In the later centuries,
the life of the village

00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:12.870
was shaped by the Lázár
family of Lăzarea,

00:02:12.894 --> 00:02:16.270
particularly following the
marriage of Bora Gyulakutai

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.118
to Imre Lázár, the royal
judge of Mureș Seat.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.077
They erected a manor at the
heart of their estate. By the

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.500
early 1600s, through the
influence of János IV Lázár,

00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:31.735
the family converted from Roman
Catholicism to the Reformed

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.524
faith and became generous
supporters of their church.

00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:43.548
Among the ranks of church benefactors, another
name stands out: János Szövérdi Gáspár.

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:48.862
He was born in 1570 into a primipilus
family from Suveica. At the

00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:54.072
age of 30, he attained noble rank
from Prince Sigismund Báthory,

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:56.676
with his coat of arms featuring a
unicorn emerging from a crown.

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.296
The foundation of his wealth lay
in his ancient Székely heritage,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.214
but his rise to prominence was
owed to his connection with the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.720
Lázár family. After the death
of the elderly János Lázár,

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:13.779
he became the ward of his underage
son, later marrying the widow, Kata

00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:18.744
Safarith, thus gaining considerable
wealth and important connections.

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:27.568
Upon his wife’s death, he remarried. His
second wife, Zsófia Bethlen, was half his age.

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:32.953
János Gáspár proved to be a
successful career diplomat. In

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:37.092
1606, he served as the envoy
of Transylvania to Košice,

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:43.416
then again in 1608, and in 1610, he became
the chief royal judge of Mureș Seat.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.907
He was a confidant of
Transylvanian princes such as

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:50.864
Sigismund Báthory, Sigismund
Rákóczi, and Gabriel Bethlen.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.624
In 1617, he acted as the
envoy of Gabriel Bethlen

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.500
to Constantinople, meeting
with Emperor Murad.

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:04.585
For his services, he received titles
and land grants. He was first

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.048
appointed as the seneschal of the
Princess, then of the princely court.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.100
Significant portions of land and entire
villages came into his possession:

00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:22.860
Călimănești, Fântânele, Bedeni,
Vădaș, Suveica, Hotești, Sovata,

00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:29.524
Rigmani, Sântandrei, Drojdii,
Câmpenița, and Viforoasa,

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:36.848
later followed by Pănet, Hărțău,
Filia, Nicolești, Senereuș, and Beța.

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:42.190
In the capital of Transylvania, Alba
Iulia, he also had a house on Saint

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:47.896
Michael Street, which was essential for
the duties he performed at the court.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.960
At the peak of his success, he
did not forget about his church.

00:04:52.984 --> 00:04:57.196
In 1623, he donated an ancient
chalice to the church,

00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.784
which was already
considered old in his time.

00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:08.208
About the gilded silver artwork crafted at
the end of the 1400s, Balázs Orbán wrote:

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:14.053
“In terms of both beauty and antiquity,
it has few equals in the country.

00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:20.032
The most beautiful enamel shines through
the finest lace-like perforations,

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:24.927
with circular medallions
alternately featuring Jesus and

00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:29.456
Mary monograms on blue and
green enamel backgrounds.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.465
On its base, there are shield-shaped
medallions (…) executed

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.580
with such delicate craftsmanship,
such pure artistic taste (…)

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:43.904
that we truly must admire the skill of the
hand guided by artistic sensibility.”

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.480
During the difficult years of the 1930s,
the church decided to sell the chalice.

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:56.254
Count Miklós Bánffy paid 250,000
lei for it – using this sum, the

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:01.004
building of the church school was
erected adjacent to the temple.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:05.628
Today, the chalice is owned by
the Hungarian National Museum.

00:06:06.652 --> 00:06:10.640
The most striking artwork
in the church is the

00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:15.052
coffered ceiling of the
sanctuary, painted in 1625.

00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:19.316
According to the inscription,
it was commissioned by

00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.500
János Szövérdi Gáspár and
his wife, Zsófia Bethlen.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.502
Initially, it was believed
that the creator was János

00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:32.800
Egerházy from Band, the court
painter of Gabriel Bethlen.

00:06:32.824 --> 00:06:35.895
However, more recent data
suggests that the work might be

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.148
attributed to a master active
in the vicinity of Sighișoara.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.797
János Gáspár did not have the
opportunity to admire the

00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:49.000
completed ceiling. In the spring
of 1625, the Prince sent him

00:06:49.024 --> 00:06:52.603
on a main envoy mission
with Transylvania’s taxes

00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:55.848
to Constantinople from
his court in Făgăraș.

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:59.506
The construction of the ceiling could
not have started at that time,

00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:02.048
as the unheated church would not
have been conducive to painting.

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:04.809
The artist likely began
his work only from the

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:07.396
warmer springtime,
perhaps after Pentecost.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.356
The mission extended for a
long period, and János Gáspár

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:14.300
only began his journey
home the following summer.

00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:18.438
However, on July 1, 1626,
he unexpectedly passed away

00:07:18.463 --> 00:07:22.348
in the fields near Bucharest.
He was 55 years old.

00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:27.807
His body was brought back to the
Reformed church, and he was interred

00:07:27.832 --> 00:07:31.972
in the aristocratic crypt below
the floor level near the pulpit.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.679
His widow erected an ornate
tombstone, which is still

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:38.800
visible today, built into
the wall of the sanctuary.

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:43.907
Later, Zsófia Bethlen was also buried
next to her husband, and over time, the

00:07:43.932 --> 00:07:48.924
existence of the sealed crypt from the
1600s gradually faded into obscurity.

00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:54.128
The oral tradition, which speaks of
crypts hiding treasures and tunnels

00:07:54.153 --> 00:07:58.972
connecting churches and castles,
is not usually taken seriously...

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.598
During the restoration of the church
in 2021, archaeologists excavated

00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:08.744
the area where, according to
tradition, a crypt was hidden.

00:08:09.744 --> 00:08:13.739
To their greatest astonishment,
they came across a tunnel-like

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:17.568
brick structure sealed with
river stones: a burial chamber.

00:08:18.568 --> 00:08:21.637
The discovery was a
professional sensation: no

00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:24.992
living person had entered
the crypt for 300 years!

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:31.092
Over the centuries, the vaulted cavity
was often filled with groundwater.

00:08:31.116 --> 00:08:34.313
As a result, the archaeological
material was preserved in a

00:08:34.338 --> 00:08:37.640
layer of mud nearly half a meter
thick, scattered throughout.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.182
Anthropological analysis
identified the remains of three to

00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:46.024
four adults and four to five
children under the age of 10.

00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:50.235
Among these are the
earthly remains of János

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.548
Szövérdi Gáspár, Kata
Safarith, and Zsófia Bethlen.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.418
During the sieving of the
debris, valuable gold artifacts

00:08:59.443 --> 00:09:03.200
were also unearthed: Zsófia
Bethlen’s wedding ring,

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:09.224
a signet ring, two signet rings with heads,
and a Turkish imported garment ornament.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:16.148
The splendor of the burials is indicated
by the star-shaped silver coffin fittings.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.600
The ancient patrons of Fântânele may
have descended into the grave, but their

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:25.920
legacy, their spirit, lives on within
the walls of the medieval church.

00:09:25.944 --> 00:09:30.947
The legacy of the church nave, which
existed during the time of the papal

00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:35.544
tithe collectors, with its carved
Gothic windows, fresco fragments,

00:09:35.568 --> 00:09:39.160
painted ceiling, and heraldic
tombstones, alongside

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:42.268
the newly discovered
Szövérdi–Bethlen crypt,

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:46.208
has opened an exciting chapter
in our understanding of the

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:49.816
past. Let us wisely steward
the treasures left to us!
