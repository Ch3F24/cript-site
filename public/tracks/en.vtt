In 2021, a comprehensive archaeological study was conducted
in the Reformed church of Fântânele,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:19.140
involving the excavation of 19 archaeological trenches,
covering both the interior of the church and the churchyard.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:27.864
Due to the burial customs typical of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period,
the entire interior of the church is almost filled with early graves.

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:38.788
Therefore, during the excavation of these early graves, all previous evidence and constructions were either dismantled or destroyed by the grave pits.

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:48.512
At the northern wall, we were able to observe an earlier archaeological assemblage, presumably an Árpádian-era dwe lling.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:52.336
It appears that the  corner of the plot was cut off by the tower of the church nave.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:01.560
During the excavation, we found fragments of Árpádian-era pottery and net weights,
all of which are associated with this type of archaeological find.

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:08.984
It’s conceivable that the early Árpádian settlement extended from here
to the northern boundary of the present-day village,

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:18.108
on the opposite side of the main road, but this cannot be conclusively
proven without archaeological excavations.

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:25.432
Undeniably, the most important and exciting part of the
excavation was the exploration of the crypt itself.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:39.456
We discovered a very intriguing semi-circular entrance,
leading to a substantial tomb structure with a diameter of over 2 meters,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:49.080
constructed with meticulous brick walls, a testament to the
craftsmanship of several skilled artisans.

00:01:49.104 --> 00:01:58.604
And it’s significant because the entire tomb structure provided a wealth of new information about the early modern aristocratic crypts of Transylvania:

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:08.228
we learned about how ventilation was established,
as we found the cap of the ventilation shaft at the top of the vault.

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:15.252
Additionally, we observed how the coffins could have been positioned
within this chamber.

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:23.576
The most exciting aspect of all this is that we’re dealing with a tomb structure
that remains untouched anthropogenically.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:35.900
There are no traces of human intervention, but the effects of leakage and previous floods or water movements have completely dama  ged the interior of the crypt.

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:43.224
However, within a layer of mud about 60-70 centimeters thick, the remains of those interred here are remarkably well preserved, almost like in a time capsule.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:55.848
We found numerous valuable jewels, including gold jewelry
associated with members of the Szövérdi–Bethlen family.

00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:04.372
Throughout the excavation, we had the opportunity to conduct local rapid anthropological analyses of the skeletons.

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:15.096
We were able to identify the remains of approximately three to four
adult individuals and five to six children who died before the age of ten.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:30.120
Out of respect, the skeletons were reburied, but samples were taken
from each skeleton for further analysis.
